Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
I know exactly what you are

Opaque ball of hot dense gas
Million times our planet's mass
Looking small because you're far
I know exactly what you are

Fusing atoms in your core
Hydrogen, helium, carbon and more [Note that these have to be pronounced as quick triplets for proper scansion, i.e. "hy-dro-gen, hel-li-um, car-bon-and, more"...]
With such power you shine far
Twinkle twinkle little star

Classed by their spectroscopy
Oh, Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me
Bright when close and faint when far
I know exactly what you are

Smallest ones burn cool and slow
Still too hot to visit, though
Red stars dominate by far
Twinkle twinkle little star

Largest ones are hot and blue
Supernova when they're through
Then black hole or neutron star
I know exactly what you are

Our Sun's average as stars go
Formed 5 billion years ago
Halfway through its life so far
Twinkle twinkle little star

(new verse! 7.23.12)
Sunspots look dark but they're bright
Slightly cooler so less light
Temporary surface scar
I know exactly what you are

(new verse! 7.23.12)
Swelling up before it's dead
Cooling off and growing red
Then its end is not so far
Twinkle twinkle giant star

(new verse! 7.23.12)
Outer layers float away
Planetary Nebulae [pronounced "NEH-byoo-LAY"]
Wispy gas is gossamer
I know exactly what you were

(new verse! 7.23.12)
Interstellar medium
Recycled ad nauseam
Gas and dust are spread afar
Twinkle twinkle little star

Forming from collapsing clouds
Cold and dusty gas enshrouds
Spinning, heating protostar
I know exactly what you are

(updated 7.23.12)
Two stars make a binary
Or a triple if there's three
Some are solo just like ours
Twinkle twinkle little stars

Often forming multiply [pronounced "MAHLT - eh - PLEE"]
Clusters bound by gravity
Open type or globular [pronounced "GLAH-byoo-LAHR" to make the rhyme work. Note this is a slight variant on the standard pronunciation "GLAH-byoo-ler"]
I know exactly what you are

Two hundred billion stars all stay
Bound up in the Milky Way
Dusty spiral with a bar
Twinkle twinkle little star

Stars have planets orbiting
Rocky or gassy, moons or rings
Earth's unique with life so far
I know exactly what you are.
